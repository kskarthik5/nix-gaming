Subject: [PATCH 067/170] winewayland.drv: Handle interactive window movement.

Propagate window movement requests to the compositor. Note that although
the Wayland surface may move on screen, the client (Wine in this case)
is never aware, since such absolute positioning information is not
provided by the Wayland protocol.
